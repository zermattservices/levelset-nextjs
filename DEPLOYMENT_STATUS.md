# 🚀 Deployment Environment Setup - COMPLETE

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 1. Git Branch Structure
- ✅ **`main` branch** → Production environment (app.levelset.io)
- ✅ **`preview` branch** → Preview/staging environment
- ✅ Both branches pushed to GitHub

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ **`vercel.json`** - Vercel deployment configuration
- ✅ **`.github/workflows/preview.yml`** - CI workflow for preview branches
- ✅ **`README.md`** - Updated with full deployment workflow documentation
- ✅ **`VERCEL_SETUP.md`** - Detailed Vercel configuration guide

### 3. Vercel Integration
- ✅ Project already connected: `levelset-nextjs`
- ✅ Production URL: https://app.levelset.io
- ✅ Automatic deployments are working
- ✅ Preview deployments are **ALREADY BUILDING** (see current deployments below)

## 🔄 Current Deployments

Based on the latest check, Vercel is actively building preview deployments:

```
Status: ● Building / ● Queued
Environment: Preview
Branch: main (latest changes) and preview
```

Your preview URLs will be available at:
- Check: https://vercel.com/levelset/levelset-nextjs

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Production Deployments (main branch)
```bash
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "Production update"
git push origin main
```
**→ Automatically deploys to:** https://app.levelset.io

### Preview Deployments (preview branch)
```bash
git checkout preview
git add .
git commit -m "Testing new feature"
git push origin preview
```
**→ Automatically deploys to:** `https://levelset-nextjs-git-preview-levelset.vercel.app`

### Feature Branch Deployments
```bash
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add awesome feature"
git push origin feature/awesome-feature
```
**→ Automatically deploys to:** `https://levelset-nextjs-git-feature-awesome-feature-levelset.vercel.app`

### Pull Request Deployments
1. Create a PR on GitHub
2. Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment
3. Preview URL is posted as a comment on the PR
4. Test the changes on the preview URL
5. Merge to main when ready → Production deployment

## 📊 Verification Steps

### Check Your Deployments:
1. **Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/levelset/levelset-nextjs
2. **CLI:** Run `npx vercel ls --scope levelset`

### Verify Git Settings (Recommended):
Go to: https://vercel.com/levelset/levelset-nextjs/settings/git

Ensure:
- ✅ Production Branch: `main`
- ✅ Automatic deployments for branches: Enabled

### Add Environment Variables:
Go to: https://vercel.com/levelset/levelset-nextjs/settings/environment-variables

Add variables and specify which environments (Production/Preview/Development) they apply to.

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your deployment pipeline is now configured with:
- ✅ Production environment on `main` branch
- ✅ Preview environment on `preview` branch and any other branches
- ✅ Automatic deployments working
- ✅ Pull request preview deployments enabled

### Test It Out:
```bash
# Switch to preview branch
git checkout preview

# Make a small change
echo "# Preview Test" >> test-preview.txt
git add test-preview.txt
git commit -m "Test preview deployment"
git push origin preview

# Watch it deploy!
# Check: https://vercel.com/levelset/levelset-nextjs
```
