# Levelset Product Context

Reference doc for writing accurate marketing copy. When writing about the product, consult this file to avoid inaccuracies.

## What Levelset Is

A team management platform built exclusively for Chick-fil-A operators. It replaces scattered spreadsheets, paper trackers, and binders with a connected platform the whole leadership team shares.

The key value proposition: **operators bring their own operational playbook** (positions, discipline rules, rating criteria) and Levelset connects it all in one place. It is not prescriptive — it adapts to how the operator already runs their restaurant.

## Core Features (Available to All Users)

### 1. Positional Ratings (PEA)

- Team members are rated **by position** (not a single overall rating)
- Each position has its own set of behavioral criteria (the "Big 5" — configurable per org)
- Ratings are on a **1–5 scale** (NOT 0–4)
- Color-coded zones: Red (needs improvement), Yellow (on the rise), Green (strong performer)
- Positions are split into FOH (front of house) and BOH (back of house)
- Position names are org-specific (e.g., iPOS, Breader, Fries, Host — these are CFA terms)
- Rolling averages calculated over a configurable window
- Leaders submit ratings; the system aggregates into averages per employee per position

**Marketing language**: "Rate by position" / "positional ratings" / "see who's ready for every position"
**Do NOT say**: specific scales, specific position names (too internal), "rolling averages update daily" (too technical)

### 2. Discipline Tracking

- **Org-configurable**: operators set their own infraction types, point values, and discipline thresholds
- Infractions accumulate points over a rolling window
- System automatically recommends the next disciplinary step based on the org's own rules
- Leaders can record, dismiss, or escalate recommendations
- Full documentation trail: notes, signatures, attached documents

**Marketing language**: "Bring your discipline process" / "your rules, enforced consistently" / "every leader follows the same process"
**Do NOT say**: specific discipline steps (verbal, written, suspension — these are per-org), specific point values, "points-based system" (too technical for marketing)

### 3. Team Roster

- Central employee database: name, position eligibility, pay, hire date, availability, history
- FOH/BOH eligibility, leader/trainer flags
- Pay configuration tied to roles (org-specific pay rules)
- Active/inactive status, termination tracking
- Bulk import and sync from external systems

**Marketing language**: "One roster for your entire team" / "every detail in one place" / "stop digging through spreadsheets"

### 4. Evaluations

- Formal employee evaluations
- Connected to ratings data
- Available to all orgs

### 5. Documents

- Organization-level document library
- Category-based organization
- Upload, share, and manage operational documents
