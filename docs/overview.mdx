# Welcome to Levelset

Levelset is a team performance platform that helps you track how your employees perform, manage discipline consistently, and develop your team over time.

## What Is Levelset?

Levelset gives you the tools to:

- **See how your team is performing** at a glance
- **Rate employees** on specific positions and skills
- **Track discipline** with a consistent, documented process
- **Manage your roster** of employees and their roles

Whether you're running one location or several, Levelset keeps everything organized in one place.

## Core Features

### Positional Excellence

Rate team members on how well they perform in specific positions.

    Each position (like Register, Drive-Thru, or Grill) has 5 criteria that define what good performance looks like.
  </Card>
  <Card title="1-3 Rating Scale" icon="star">
    Simple scoring: **Not Yet** (1), **On the Rise** (2), or **Crushing It** (3).
  </Card>

## The Dashboard vs Mobile App

Levelset has two ways to access it:

| Platform | Best For | Access |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Web Dashboard** | Viewing reports, managing settings, full feature access | [app.levelset.io](https://app.levelset.io) |
| **Mobile App** | Submitting ratings and infractions on the floor | Same URL on your phone |

Leadership typically uses the dashboard for analysis and management. Supervisors often use mobile to submit ratings during shifts.

## Who Uses Levelset?

- **Operators/Owners** - Full control over everything
- **Directors/Managers** - View reports, submit ratings, manage discipline
- **Supervisors/Team Leads** - Submit ratings for their team
