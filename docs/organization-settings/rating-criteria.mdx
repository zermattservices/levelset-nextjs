description: Define the Big 5 rating criteria for each position

# Rating Criteria

Each position has 5 rating criteria (the "Big 5") that define what excellence looks like in that role. This guide covers how to set up and customize these criteria.

## Accessing Rating Criteria

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Select **Positional Excellence** in the left menu
3. Click the **Rating Criteria** tab

## Understanding Rating Criteria

### What Are Rating Criteria?

Rating criteria are the specific skills or behaviors that leaders evaluate when rating a team member in a position. Each position has exactly 5 criteria.

### Example: iPOS Criteria

| # | Criterion | What It Measures |
|---|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Speed | How quickly orders are taken |
| 2 | Accuracy | Order accuracy and attention to detail |
| 3 | Guest Interaction | Friendliness and engagement |
| 4 | Order Knowledge | Menu knowledge and suggestive selling |
| 5 | Payment Handling | Cash and card transaction accuracy |

## Setting Up Criteria

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Position">
    Use the dropdown at the top to select the position you want to configure. Positions are grouped by FOH and BOH.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Criterion Names">
    For each of the 5 criteria:
    - Enter a short, clear name (e.g., "Speed", "Accuracy")
    - Keep names concise - they appear in tables and forms
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Descriptions">
    For each criterion, add a description that explains:
    - What this criterion measures
    - What excellence looks like
    - Specific behaviors to look for
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes auto-save as you edit. When you switch positions or leave the page, your changes are preserved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Good Criterion Names

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It Short" icon="scissors">
    One or two words is ideal. "Speed" not "How quickly they complete tasks"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Order Accuracy" is better than "Quality"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Action-Oriented" icon="play">
    Focus on observable behaviors
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Unique" icon="fingerprint">
    Each criterion should measure something different
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Writing Good Descriptions

Descriptions appear in the rating form to help leaders rate consistently.

### Good Description Example

```
Speed: Rate based on how quickly the team member processes 
orders while maintaining accuracy. Consider line management, 
payment speed, and ability to keep up during peak times.

3 - Crushing It: Consistently fast, never a bottleneck
2 - On the Rise: Good pace with occasional slowdowns
1 - Not Yet: Regularly causes delays in the line
```

### Description Tips

- Explain what each rating level looks like
- Include specific examples when helpful
- Keep descriptions scannable (use short paragraphs)
- Focus on observable behaviors, not attitudes

## Position-Specific Considerations

Different positions need different criteria:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="FOH Positions">
    Focus on:
    - Guest interaction quality
    - Speed and efficiency
    - Order accuracy
    - Teamwork and communication
    - Cleanliness and presentation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="BOH Positions">
    Focus on:
    - Food quality and safety
    - Speed and timing
    - Following procedures
    - Waste management
    - Station organization
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Criteria Patterns

While every position is different, some criteria appear frequently:

| Criterion Type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| Speed/Efficiency | Speed, Pace, Timing, Efficiency |
| Quality | Accuracy, Quality, Consistency |
| Standards | Procedures, Safety, Cleanliness |
| Teamwork | Communication, Support, Coordination |
| Knowledge | Product Knowledge, Menu, Systems |

## Modifying Existing Criteria

When updating criteria for a position that already has ratings:

<Note>
Changing criterion names or descriptions affects how future ratings are labeled but does not change historical data. Previous ratings keep their original criterion names.
</Note>

Consider:
- Will the change confuse leaders?
- Should you communicate the change to the team?
- Is this a minor wording update or a fundamental change?

## Empty Criteria

If a position doesn't have criteria defined:

1. Navigate to Rating Criteria
2. Select the position
3. You'll see 5 empty criterion slots
4. Fill in each one with a name and description

<Warning>
Positions without rating criteria won't appear in the rating form. Make sure all positions have their Big 5 defined.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Criteria not showing in rating form">
    Verify that:
    - All 5 criteria have names (descriptions are optional but recommended)
    - The position is correctly set up in the Positions tab
    - The user has permission to rate that position
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong criteria showing for a position">
    Double-check that you selected the correct position in the dropdown. Similar position names can be confusing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Description field not expanding">
    The description field should auto-expand as you type. If it doesn't, try clicking into the field and pressing Enter to add lines.
  </Accordion>
