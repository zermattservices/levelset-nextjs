Each position has 5 criteria that define what you're rating. This guide shows you how to set them up.

## Accessing Rating Criteria

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Positional Excellence** in the sidebar
3. Select the **Rating Criteria** tab

## How Criteria Work

### What Are Rating Criteria?

Criteria are the specific skills or behaviors you evaluate when rating someone. Each position has exactly 5 criteria.

### Example: iPOS

| # | Criterion                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Smile & Shine            | Wave high, greet warmly, and set the tone with joy. Use the Core 4 for every guest interaction—it's their first impression of us.                                                                  |
| 2 | Catch Every Detail       | Get names, cars, plates, and lanes right—every time.                                                                                                                                               |
| 3 | Lead, Offer, Repeat      | Lead the guest in the ordering (actively using the guest name), offer to scan the app, offer seasonal items & ask to make EVERY order large, & repeat it back line by line.                        |
| 4 | Close Gaps & Call It Out | Keep the line tight, speak loud & clear, help the team flow.                                                                                                                                       |
| 5 | Friendly Farewell        | Ask if there's anything else you can do to serve our guests and send them off with a warm 'See you again soon.' This is the most impressionable role in the entire guest experience—make it count! |

## Setting Up Criteria

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Position">
    Use the dropdown at the top to choose which position you're configuring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Criterion Names">
    For each of the 5 slots:

    - Enter a short, clear name
    - Keep it to a few words (e.g., "Speed", "Food Quality", "Friendly Fairwell")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Descriptions">
    For each criterion, write a description explaining:

    - What this criterion measures
    - What good performance looks like
    - Specific behaviors to observe
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes auto-save when you click away or switch positions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Good Criterion Names

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It Short" icon="minimize">
    1-2 words is ideal. Names appear in tables and reports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Order Accuracy" is better than "Quality"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Make It Observable" icon="eye">
    Focus on things you can actually see and measure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep Them Distinct" icon="code-branch">
    Each criterion should measure something different
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Writing Good Descriptions

Descriptions appear in the rating form to help raters be consistent.

### What to Include

1. **What you're measuring** - Be specific about the skill or behavior
2. **What each level looks like** - Help raters know when to give a 1, 2, or 3
3. **Examples** - Concrete behaviors to look for

## Common Criteria Categories

Most positions include criteria from these categories:

| Category             | Examples                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed/Efficiency** | Speed, Pace, Timing, Throughput             |
| **Quality**          | Accuracy, Consistency, Attention to Detail  |
| **Standards**        | Cleanliness, Safety, Following Procedures   |
| **People Skills**    | Communication, Teamwork, Guest Interaction  |
| **Knowledge**        | Product Knowledge, Systems, Problem Solving |

## Updating Existing Criteria

If you change criteria for a position that already has ratings:

- **Historical and new ratings** use the updated criteria
- **Averages** continue to calculate normally

<Tip>
  For minor wording improvements, just update the text. For major changes to what you're measuring, consider whether it makes sense to start fresh or keep the historical data.
</Tip>

## Positions Without Criteria

If a position doesn't have criteria set up:

- It **won't appear** in rating forms
- You **can't submit ratings** for that position
- You'll see 5 empty slots when you select it

Always set up all 5 criteria for every position you want to rate.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Position isn't showing up in rating form">
    Make sure all 5 criteria have names. Even if descriptions are optional, names are required for the position to be ratable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong criteria showing up">
    Double-check that you selected the correct position in the dropdown. Similar position names can be confusing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Criteria aren't saving">
    Click outside the field to trigger auto-save. If the issue persists, refresh the page and try again.
