# Rating Criteria

Each position has 5 criteria that define what you're rating. This guide shows you how to set them up.

## Accessing Rating Criteria

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Positional Excellence** in the sidebar
3. Select the **Rating Criteria** tab

## How Criteria Work

### What Are Rating Criteria?

Criteria are the specific skills or behaviors you evaluate when rating someone. Each position has exactly 5 criteria.

### Example: Register/iPOS

| # | Criterion | What It Measures |
|---|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Speed | How quickly they process orders |
| 2 | Accuracy | Order accuracy, correct items |
| 3 | Guest Interaction | Friendliness, eye contact, engagement |
| 4 | Menu Knowledge | Knows products, can make suggestions |
| 5 | Payment Handling | Cash and card transactions |

## Setting Up Criteria

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the Position">
    Use the dropdown at the top to choose which position you're configuring.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Criterion Names">
    For each of the 5 slots:
    - Enter a short, clear name
    - Keep it to 1-3 words (e.g., "Speed", "Food Quality", "Team Support")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Descriptions">
    For each criterion, write a description explaining:
    - What this criterion measures
    - What good performance looks like
    - Specific behaviors to observe
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes auto-save when you click away or switch positions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Good Criterion Names

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It Short" icon="minimize">
    1-2 words is ideal. Names appear in tables and reports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Order Accuracy" is better than "Quality"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Make It Observable" icon="eye">
    Focus on things you can actually see and measure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep Them Distinct" icon="code-branch">
    Each criterion should measure something different
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Writing Good Descriptions

Descriptions appear in the rating form to help raters be consistent.

### What to Include

1. **What you're measuring** - Be specific about the skill or behavior
2. **What each level looks like** - Help raters know when to give a 1, 2, or 3
3. **Examples** - Concrete behaviors to look for

### Example Description

```
Speed

Rate how quickly the team member processes orders while maintaining quality.

3 (Crushing It): Consistently fast, keeps the line moving, never a bottleneck
2 (On the Rise): Good pace overall, occasional slowdowns during rushes
1 (Not Yet): Regularly causes delays, struggles to keep up with line speed

Look for: Order entry time, payment processing speed, ability to multitask
```

## Common Criteria Categories

Most positions include criteria from these categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Speed/Efficiency** | Speed, Pace, Timing, Throughput |
| **Quality** | Accuracy, Consistency, Attention to Detail |
| **Standards** | Cleanliness, Safety, Following Procedures |
| **People Skills** | Communication, Teamwork, Guest Interaction |
| **Knowledge** | Product Knowledge, Systems, Problem Solving |

## Updating Existing Criteria

If you change criteria for a position that already has ratings:

- **Historical ratings** keep their original criterion labels
- **New ratings** use the updated criteria
- **Averages** continue to calculate normally

<Tip>
For minor wording improvements, just update the text. For major changes to what you're measuring, consider whether it makes sense to start fresh or keep the historical data.
</Tip>

## Positions Without Criteria

If a position doesn't have criteria set up:

- It **won't appear** in rating forms
- You **can't submit ratings** for that position
- You'll see 5 empty slots when you select it

Always set up all 5 criteria for every position you want to rate.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Position isn't showing up in rating form">
    Make sure all 5 criteria have names. Even if descriptions are optional, names are required for the position to be ratable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong criteria showing up">
    Double-check that you selected the correct position in the dropdown. Similar position names can be confusing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Criteria aren't saving">
    Click outside the field to trigger auto-save. If the issue persists, refresh the page and try again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
