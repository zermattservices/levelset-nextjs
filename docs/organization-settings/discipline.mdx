# Discipline Settings

Configure how the discipline system works for your organization, including infraction types, point values, actions, and who can access discipline features.

## Accessing Discipline Settings

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Discipline** in the sidebar

## Infractions Tab

### What Are Infractions?

Infractions are the types of policy violations you can document. Each infraction has:

- **Name** - What you call this infraction type
- **Point Value** - How many points it adds to an employee's total
- **Description** - Details about when to use this type

### Default Infraction Types

Common infractions include:

| Infraction | Typical Points | When to Use |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Tardiness | 1 | Arriving late for a shift |
| No Call No Show | 3 | Missing a shift without notification |
| Uniform Violation | 1 | Not following dress code |
| Policy Violation | 2 | Breaking a workplace policy |
| Insubordination | 3 | Refusing to follow instructions |

### Adding an Infraction Type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Infraction">
    Look for the **Add Infraction** button below the existing types.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter the Name">
    Give the infraction a clear, descriptive name.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set the Point Value">
    Enter how many points this infraction should add. Higher values for more serious violations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Description">
    Explain when this infraction type should be used. This helps ensure consistent documentation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click away or click Save to store the new infraction type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing Infraction Types

1. Click on any field (name, points, or description)
2. Make your changes
3. Click away to auto-save

### Removing Infraction Types

1. Click the **delete icon** next to the infraction
2. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting an infraction type doesn't remove historical records that used it. Those records remain in employee histories with the original type name.
</Warning>

## Actions Tab

### What Are Actions?

Actions are the progressive discipline steps triggered when employees reach point thresholds. Each action has:

- **Name** - What you call this action (e.g., "Verbal Warning")
- **Point Threshold** - When this action is triggered
- **Description** - What this action means

### Default Actions

A typical progressive discipline setup:

| Action | Points | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Verbal Warning | 3 | First threshold reached |
| Written Warning | 6 | Second threshold reached |
| Final Warning | 9 | Third threshold reached |
| Termination | 12 | Maximum threshold reached |

### Setting Up Actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Action">
    Add a new action to your progression.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter the Action Name">
    Use clear names like "Verbal Warning" or "Written Warning".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set the Point Threshold">
    Enter the point total that triggers this action. Actions should have progressively higher thresholds.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Description">
    Explain what happens at this step and any documentation requirements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Actions Work

When an employee's point total reaches or exceeds a threshold:

1. The system displays the recommended action on the Discipline Dashboard
2. Leadership sees which employees need attention
3. After delivering the action, you can mark it as completed

## Access Tab

### Controlling Who Can Use Discipline

The Access tab controls:

- Who can **view** discipline records
- Who can **submit** infractions
- Whether a **password** is required to submit

### Discipline Access Settings

| Setting | What It Controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| **View Access** | Which role levels can see discipline records |
| **Submit Access** | Which role levels can document infractions |
| **Password Required** | Whether submitting requires a password |
| **Password** | The password required to submit (if enabled) |

### Setting Up Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure View Access">
    Select which roles can view discipline records. Typically all leadership roles.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Submit Access">
    Select which roles can submit infractions. Usually managers and above.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable/Disable Password">
    Toggle whether a password is required to submit infractions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set the Password">
    If enabled, enter the password that will be required. Share this only with authorized personnel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why Use a Password?

A submission password adds accountability:

- Ensures only authorized people submit infractions
- Creates a small barrier to prevent accidental submissions
- Allows you to change access without changing roles

## Notifications Tab

### Discipline Notifications

Configure who gets notified when discipline events occur:

- **Email notifications** when employees reach thresholds
- **Dashboard alerts** for pending actions
- **Summary reports** on discipline activity

### Notification Settings

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Threshold Alerts** | Notify when an employee reaches an action threshold |
| **Weekly Summary** | Send a summary of discipline activity |
| **Recipients** | Who receives these notifications |

## Best Practices

### Point Values

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It Simple" icon="minimize">
    Use small numbers (1-3) for most infractions. It's easier to understand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scale by Severity" icon="scale-balanced">
    More serious violations should have higher point values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Consistent" icon="equals">
    Similar infractions should have similar point values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consider Accumulation" icon="calculator">
    Think about how quickly points accumulate to thresholds.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Action Thresholds

- **Space them appropriately** - Give employees room to improve between actions
- **Progressive severity** - Each threshold should be more serious
- **Clear expectations** - Document what happens at each level

### Password Security

- Use a unique password (not a common word or date)
- Change it periodically
- Only share with authorized leadership
- Don't write it where others can see

## Troubleshooting
