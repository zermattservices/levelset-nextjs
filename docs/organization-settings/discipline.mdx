Configure how the discipline system works for your organization, including infraction types, point values, actions, and who can access discipline features.

## Accessing Discipline Settings

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Discipline** in the sidebar

## Infractions Tab

### What Are Infractions?

Infractions are the types of policy violations you can document. Each infraction has:

- **Name** - What you call this infraction type
- **Point Value** - How many points it adds to an employee's total
- **Description** - Details about when to use this type

<Note>
  Infractions and Actions are not set up by default. In order to use this feature, you must configure your points system in Organization Settings.
</Note>

### Adding an Infraction Type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Infraction">
    Look for the **Add Infraction** button below the existing types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the Name">
    Give the infraction a clear, descriptive name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the Point Value">
    Enter how many points this infraction should add. Higher values for more serious violations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click away or click Save to store the new infraction type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing Infraction Types

1. Click on any field (name, points, or description)
2. Make your changes
3. Click away to auto-save

### Removing Infraction Types

1. Click the **delete icon** next to the infraction
2. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting an infraction type doesn't remove historical records that used it. Those records remain in employee histories with the original type name.
</Warning>

## Actions Tab

### What Are Actions?

Actions are the progressive discipline steps triggered when employees reach point thresholds. Each action has:

- **Name** - What you call this action (e.g., "Verbal Warning")
- **Point Threshold** - When this action is triggered

### Setting Up Actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Action">
    Add a new action to your progression.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the Action Name">
    Use clear names like "Verbal Warning" or "Written Warning".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the Point Threshold">
    Enter the point total that triggers this action. Actions should have progressively higher thresholds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click away or click Save to store the new action type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Actions Work

When an employee's point total reaches or exceeds a threshold:

1. The system displays the recommended action on the Discipline Dashboard
2. Leadership sees which employees need attention
3. After completing and communicating the action, you can mark it as completed

## Access Tab

### Controlling Who Can Use Discipline

The Access tab controls:

- Who can **view** discipline records
- Who can **submit** infractions
- Whether a **password** is required to submit

### Discipline Access Settings

The Discipline Access settings control which roles in your organization can submit discipline infractions. Changing these settings will impact which leaders show in the discipline form leader dropdown.

You can also configure a password to protect the discipline form. By default, a password is applied to the form.

<Note>
  This is useful if you have trainers with the mobile app that can submit positional ratings but shouldn't be able to submit infractions
</Note>
