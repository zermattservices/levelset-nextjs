Users settings controls who can log into the Levelset dashboard. This is separate from the employee roster—users are people with login credentials.

## Accessing Users Settings

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Users** under Users and Security

## Users vs Employees

It's important to understand the difference:

| Concept      | Description                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Employee** | Someone on your roster. May or may not have login access. |
| **User**     | Someone with login credentials for the dashboard.         |

Most employees don't need dashboard access. Typically only leadership and management log into Levelset.

## The Two User Sections

### Leadership Team

Users who are linked to an employee record:

- They're on your roster AND have login access
- Their role comes from their employee record
- Use this for your managers, supervisors, and leaders

### Administrative Users

Users who are NOT linked to an employee:

- They're not on the employee roster
- They have the "Administrator" role
- Use this for corporate staff, consultants, or others who need access but aren't location employees

## How to Add a User

### Adding a Leadership User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add User">
    In the Leadership Team section, click **Add User**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Employee">
    Choose from the dropdown. Only employees with leadership roles appear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Their Email">
    Provide the email they'll use to log in. This may be pre-filled if they have an email on file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the User">
    Click **Create User**. A temporary password will be generated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share the Credentials">
    **Important:** Copy the email and temporary password immediately. Share them securely with the new user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding an Administrative User

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Their Information">
    - First name

## Managing Users

### Change Someone's Email

1. Click the **edit icon** (pencil) next to their email
2. Enter the new email address
3. Click the checkmark to save

<Note>
  Changing the email changes their login credential. Make sure they know to use the new email.
</Note>

### Remove User Access

1. Click the **delete icon** (trash) next to the user
2. Confirm the removal

This removes their ability to log in but does NOT:

- Delete their employee record (if they have one)
- Remove historical data they created
- Delete ratings or infractions they submitted

## Temporary Passwords

When you create a user:

1. A random temporary password is generated
2. It displays **only once** in the modal
3. You must copy it before closing

<Warning>
  If you close the modal without copying the password, you'll need to contact an administrator to reset it.
</Warning>

<Note>
  We are actively working on creating password reset functionality. We encourage you to use Google Sign-In when possible.
</Note>

## Google Sign-In

Users with Google or Google Workspace accounts can sign in with the **Sign in with Google** button. This is:

- More secure (no password to remember)
- Faster for users
- Optional (they can still use email/password)

The user's Google email must match the email in their Levelset user account.

## Who Can Manage Users

- **Operators** can add/remove any users
- **Some leadership roles** may have limited user management permissions

User management is a permission that can be controlled in Permissions. Each organization may have different settings.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Employee doesn't appear in the dropdown">
    Only employees with leadership roles (typically Level 0-2) appear. Check that:

    - The person has a leadership role in the roster
    - They don't already have a user account
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User can't log in">
    Verify:

    - They're using the exact email from their user account
    - They're entering the password correctly
    - Their user account exists in the Users list
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Need to reset a password">
    Password reset functionality is limited. Contact a Levelset administrator for help with password issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Google Sign-In isn't working">
    The user's Google email must exactly match the email in their Levelset user account. Check for typos or different email addresses.
