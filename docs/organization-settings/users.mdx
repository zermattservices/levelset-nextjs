# Users

The Users settings page controls who can log into the Levelset dashboard. This is separate from the employee roster - users are people with login credentials.

## Accessing Users

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Select **Users** in the **Users and Security** section

## Understanding Users vs Employees

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Employee** | Someone on your roster, may or may not have login access |
| **User** | Someone with a login to the Levelset dashboard |

Most employees don't need dashboard access. Typically, only leadership roles need to log in.

## User Sections

The Users page has two sections:

### Leadership Team

Users who are linked to employee records. These are team members who need dashboard access:

- Connected to an employee in the roster
- Role is pulled from their employee record
- Typically leadership positions

### Administrative Users

Users who are **not** linked to an employee record:

- Not on the employee roster
- Have the "Administrator" role
- Useful for corporate staff, consultants, or others who need access

## Adding a User

### Adding Leadership Team Member

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add User">
    In the Leadership Team section, click **Add User**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Employee">
    Choose the employee from the dropdown. Only employees with leadership roles (typically level 0-2) appear.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Email">
    Provide the email address they'll use to log in. This can be pre-filled if the employee has an email on file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create User**. A temporary password will be generated.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share Credentials">
    Copy the email and temporary password to share with the new user. They'll use these to log in for the first time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Administrative User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Administrator">
    In the Administrative Users section, click **Add Administrator**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    Provide:
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email address
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create User**. A temporary password will be generated.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share Credentials">
    Copy and share the login credentials with the new user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Existing Users

### Editing Email

1. Click the edit icon (pencil) next to the user's email
2. Enter the new email address
3. Click the checkmark to save

<Note>
Changing a user's email changes their login credential. Make sure they know the new email to use when signing in.
</Note>

### Removing Access

1. Click the delete icon (trash) next to the user
2. Confirm the removal

This removes their ability to log in but does not affect:
- Their employee record (if linked)
- Historical data they created
- Ratings they submitted

## User Roles

### Leadership Team Roles

Role is determined by the linked employee's role in the roster:

| Employee Role | User Access |
|--------------|-------------|
| Operator | Full admin access |
| Executive | Full access, limited settings |
| Director | Standard leadership access |

### Administrative Users

All administrative users have the "Administrator" role:
- Full dashboard access
- Can view all data
- Limited settings access (varies by implementation)

## Google Sign-In

Users with Google or Google Workspace email addresses can also sign in using the **Sign in with Google** button on the login page. This is optional - they can still use email/password.

## Operator Email Protection

The Operator's email can only be changed by:
- The Operator themselves
- A Levelset Admin

This prevents accidental lockout of the primary account.

## Temporary Passwords

When a user is created:

1. A random temporary password is generated
2. It's shown once in the modal - copy it immediately
3. Share securely with the new user
4. They should change it after first login (when available)

<Warning>
Temporary passwords are shown only once. If lost, contact your administrator to reset.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Minimal Access" icon="lock">
    Only create users for people who truly need dashboard access.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Secure Sharing" icon="shield">
    Share credentials securely, not via unencrypted email or chat.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Review" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Periodically review user list and remove former employees.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Google SSO" icon="google">
    Encourage Google sign-in for better security (no password to remember).
  </Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User can't log in">
    Check that:
    - They're using the correct email
    - They're entering the password correctly
    - Their user account exists in this list
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Employee not appearing in dropdown">
    Only employees with eligible roles appear. Check that:
    - The employee has a leadership role (level 0-2)
    - They don't already have a user account
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Need to reset a password">
    Password reset functionality is limited. Contact a Levelset admin to assist with password issues.
  </Accordion>
