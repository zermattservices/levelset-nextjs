# Roles Settings

Roles define the permission hierarchy in your organization. This guide shows you how to configure them.

## Accessing Roles Settings

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Roles** under Users and Security

## Understanding the Role Hierarchy

Roles are organized in order of permission level:

- **Level 0** (top) = Highest permissions (usually Operator/Owner)
- Higher numbers = Lower permissions
- Each level has different capabilities

### Example Hierarchy

```
Level 0: Operator (full access)
Level 1: Director (leadership access)
Level 2: Manager (management access)
Level 3: Supervisor (team access)
Level 4: Trainer (training access)
Level 5: Team Member (basic access)
Level 6: New Hire (minimal access)
```

<Note>
You can name roles whatever makes sense for your organization. The hierarchy level is what determines permissions.
</Note>

## What You'll See

The Roles page shows:

- **Role name** - What you call this role
- **Color** - Visual identifier for the role
- **Employee count** - How many people have this role
- **Hierarchy position** - Where it sits in the order

## Managing Roles

### Rename a Role

1. Click on the role name
2. Type the new name
3. Click away to save

### Change Role Colors

1. Click the **colored circle** next to a role
2. Select a new color from the palette
3. The color updates immediately

Colors help visually identify roles throughout Levelset.

### Reorder Roles

1. Hover over the **drag handle** (lines on the left)
2. Drag the role up or down
3. Release to set the new position

<Warning>
The top role (Operator) cannot be moved. It's always at the highest permission level.
</Warning>

### Add a New Role

1. Click **Add Role** at the bottom
2. Enter the role name
3. Drag it to the right position in the hierarchy
4. Select a color

### Delete a Role

1. Click the **delete icon** next to the role
2. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
You cannot delete a role that has employees assigned to it. Reassign those employees first.
</Warning>

## How Roles Affect Permissions

### Dashboard Access

| Level | Typical Access |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | Full access to everything |
| 1-2 | Full dashboard, most settings |
| 3+ | Limited or no dashboard access |

### Roster Management

- You can change roles for people **below** your level
- You cannot promote someone to your level or above
- Operators can change any role

### Rating Permissions

Role Mapping settings determine which roles can rate which positions. Higher roles typically have more rating access.

### Discipline Access

Discipline Access settings control which roles can view and submit infractions.

## Role Colors

Available colors include:

| Color | Best Used For |
|-------|---------------|
| Green | Entry-level, new hires |
| Blue | Standard team members |
| Purple | Leadership, management |
| Red | Alerts or special designations |
| Yellow/Amber | Mid-level roles |
| Teal | Support roles |
| Gray | Neutral designations |

Using consistent colors helps people recognize roles at a glance throughout the app.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep It Simple" icon="minimize">
    5-7 roles is usually enough. Too many creates confusion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clear Distinctions" icon="code-branch">
    Each role should have a clear purpose and different permissions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Match Your Culture" icon="building">
    Use role names that match what you call positions in real life
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Colors" icon="palette">
    Once you assign colors, keep them consistent
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't delete a role">
    Roles with employees assigned cannot be deleted. First, change those employees to a different role in the Roster.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="New role isn't showing in the roster">
    Refresh the page. New roles should appear immediately, but occasionally need a page refresh to show everywhere.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permissions aren't working as expected">
    Check Role Mapping settings for ratings, and Discipline Access settings for discipline. The role hierarchy determines the baseline, but these settings can further customize access.
  </Accordion>
