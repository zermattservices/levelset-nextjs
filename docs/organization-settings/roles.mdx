# Roles

Roles define the permission hierarchy in your organization. Configure role names, order, and colors in this settings area.

## Accessing Roles

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Select **Roles** in the **Users and Security** section

## Understanding the Role Hierarchy

Roles are organized from highest to lowest permission level:

| Level | Default Role | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Operator | Owner/operator with full access |
| 1 | Executive | Senior leadership |
| 2 | Director | Department leadership |
| 3 | Team Lead | Shift supervision |
| 4 | Trainer | Training responsibilities |
| 5 | Team Member | Standard team member |
| 6 | New Hire | Recently hired, in training |

<Note>
You can rename roles to match your organization's terminology. The hierarchy level is what determines permissions.
</Note>

## Managing Roles

### Renaming a Role

1. Click on the role name field
2. Type the new name
3. Click away to save

### Reordering Roles

Drag and drop roles to change their position in the hierarchy:

1. Hover over the drag handle (≡) on the left side of a role
2. Drag the role up or down
3. Release to set the new position

<Warning>
The Operator role (level 0) cannot be moved. It's always at the top of the hierarchy.
</Warning>

### Changing Role Colors

Each role has an assigned color:

1. Click the color circle next to a role
2. Select a new color from the palette
3. The color updates immediately

Colors appear on role badges throughout Levelset for quick visual identification.

### Adding a New Role

1. Click **Add Role** at the bottom of the list
2. Enter the role name
3. Drag it to the appropriate position in the hierarchy
4. Select a color

### Deleting a Role

1. Click the delete icon (trash) next to a role
2. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
You cannot delete the Operator role or any role that has employees assigned to it. Reassign employees first if needed.
</Warning>

## Role Permissions

Higher-level roles have more permissions:

## Role Colors

The 10 available colors are:

| Color | Hex | Best For |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Green | #dcfce7 | Positive roles, new hires |
| Blue | #dbeafe | Standard roles |
| Red | #fee2e2 | Alert or special roles |
| Amber | #fef3c7 | Mid-level leadership |
| Purple | #f3e8ff | Senior leadership |
| Teal | #ccfbf1 | Support roles |
| Pink | #fce7f3 | Unique designations |

| Indigo | #e0e7ff | Alternative leadership |

When adding a new role, a unique color is automatically assigned (avoiding duplicates when possible).

## How Roles Affect the System

Roles control access throughout Levelset:

### Roster Management
- Higher roles can change roles of those below them
- You cannot promote someone to your level or above

### Ratings
- Role Mapping determines which roles can rate which positions
- Higher roles typically can rate more positions

### Discipline
- Discipline Access controls which roles can submit infractions
- View access may also be role-dependent

### Dashboard Access
- Typically only levels 0-2 have automatic dashboard access
- Others need to be added as Users explicitly

    Role names should match what you call positions in your organization.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Clear Distinctions" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Each role should have a clear purpose and distinct permissions.

## Employee Counts

The Roles page shows how many employees are assigned to each role. Use this to:

- Verify your team structure is accurate
- Identify roles that might need review
- Plan for promotions and development

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Can't delete a role">
    Roles with employees assigned cannot be deleted. First, reassign all employees to different roles.

  <Accordion title="New role not appearing in roster">
    After adding a role, refresh the page if it doesn't immediately appear in other areas of the app.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Role colors not updating">
    Color changes should be immediate. If colors aren't updating, try refreshing the page.
