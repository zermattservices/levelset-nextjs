Positions are the specific jobs team members work and get rated on. This guide shows you how to manage them.

## Accessing Position Settings

1. Go to [**Organization Settings**](https://app.levelset.io/organization-settings)
2. Click **Positional Excellence** in the sidebar
3. Select the **Positions** tab

## Understanding Positions

### What Is a Position?

A position represents a specific job function:

**Front of House (FOH)**

- Register/iPOS
- Bagging
- Dining Room/Host
- Drinks

**Back of House (BOH)**

- Primary
- Prep
- Fries
- Breading

Your organization can define any positions that make sense for your operation.

### FOH vs BOH

Each position belongs to one category:

- **FOH**
- **BOH**

This categorization:

- Organizes positions in the dashboard
- Helps with reporting

## How to Add a Position

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Add Button">
    Look for **Add FOH Position** or **Add BOH Position** below the existing positions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the Position Name">
    Type a clear, short name (e.g., "Drive-Thru", "Grill", "Expeditor").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Description">
    Write a description explaining what this position does. This shows up in the rating form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    The position saves automatically when you click away, or click **Save Changes**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to Edit a Position

1. Find the position in the list
2. Click on the name or description field
3. Make your changes
4. Click away to save (auto-saves)

## How to Remove a Position

1. Click the **delete icon** (trash can) next to the position
2. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a position removes it from future ratings. Historical ratings are preserved, but the position won't appear in new rating submissions.
</Warning>

## Writing Good Position Descriptions

The description helps raters understand what the position involves. Include:

- **Main responsibilities** - What does this person do?
- **Key tasks** - What activities should you look for?
- **Excellence indicators** - What does great performance look like?

## Reordering Positions

Drag and drop positions to change their order:

1. Hover over the **drag handle** (the lines on the left)
2. Drag the position up or down
3. Release to set the new position

The order affects how positions appear in dropdowns, lists, and tables.

## Language Support

If your team includes Spanish speakers:

1. Switch the language toggle to **Español**
3. Use the **Auto-translate** button to translate from English
2. Customize the Spanish names and descriptions

## After Adding a Position

When you add a new position, you also need to:

1. **Define rating criteria** - Go to the Rating Criteria tab and set up the 5 criteria
2. **Set up role mapping** - Go to Role Mapping to determine who can rate this position

Without rating criteria, the position won't appear in rating forms.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Position doesn't appear in the rating form">
    Check that:

    - The position has all 5 rating criteria defined
    - The user's role has permission to rate it (Role Mapping)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't delete a position">
    Positions with historical ratings can't be fully deleted to preserve data integrity. Contact support if you need to hide a position.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes aren't saving">
    Click outside the text field to trigger auto-save. If issues persist, try clicking **Save Changes** explicitly or refreshing the page.
