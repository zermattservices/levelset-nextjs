## Understanding Positions

### What is a Position?

A position represents a specific job function in your restaurant:

- **iPOS** - Taking orders at the register
- **Host** - Greeting guests and managing the dining room
- **Breading** - Breading chicken products
- **Fries** - Managing waffle fry production

### FOH vs BOH

Positions are categorized as:

- **FOH (Front of House)** - Customer-facing roles
- **BOH (Back of House)** - Kitchen and production roles

Some positions may be marked as both if they span areas.
