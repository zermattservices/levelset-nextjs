# Viewing Discipline History

This guide shows you how to access and interpret discipline records in Levelset.

## Viewing Team Overview

### Access the Dashboard

1. Click **Discipline** in the navigation menu
2. You'll see all employees with their current status

### What the Overview Shows

| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Employee Name | Who the record is for |
| Role | Their current role |
| Points | Total accumulated points |
| Last Infraction | Most recent documented incident |
| Status | Whether action is recommended |

### Finding Employees

- **Search** by name using the search box
- **Filter** by status (e.g., only those needing action)

## Viewing Individual History

### Open an Employee's Record

Click on any employee row to expand their full discipline history.

### What You'll See

**Summary Section**
- Total current points
- Number of infractions
- Recommended action (if any)

**Infraction List**
Each infraction shows:
- Date of the incident
- Type of infraction
- Point value
- Who submitted it
- Notes/details

**Actions Taken**
- Warnings delivered
- Conversations documented
- Other actions recorded

## Understanding Point Totals

### How Points Work

- Each infraction type has an assigned point value
- Points are added when infractions are documented
- Points may expire after a period (if configured)

### Point Expiration

Some organizations set points to expire over time. For example:
- Points might expire after 6 months
- This rewards sustained good behavior
- Check with your administrator about your organization's policy

### Thresholds

When points reach certain levels, actions are recommended:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| No action | Below first threshold |
| Verbal warning | First threshold reached |
| Written warning | Second threshold reached |
| Final warning | Third threshold reached |
| Termination | Maximum threshold reached |

<Note>
Threshold names and values are configured by your organization. The above are examples.
</Note>

## Using History for Decisions

### Before Taking Action

When considering disciplinary action:

1. **Review the full history** - Don't just look at recent incidents
2. **Look for patterns** - Are infractions isolated or repeated?
3. **Check dates** - How recent are the incidents?
4. **Read the notes** - Understand the context of each incident
5. **Verify prior actions** - Were previous warnings given?

### During One-on-Ones

Use discipline history in development conversations:

- Acknowledge improvement if infractions have stopped
- Discuss patterns if issues are recurring
- Set clear expectations for the future

### For Performance Reviews

Discipline history provides objective documentation:

- Reference specific incidents with dates
- Note improvement over time
- Document ongoing concerns if applicable

## Privacy and Access

<Warning>
Discipline records contain sensitive employee information. Only access records for legitimate business purposes.
</Warning>

### Who Can See What

| Role Level | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Operators | All employee records |
| Leadership | Usually all records (depends on settings) |
| Others | Varies by organization |

### Confidentiality

- Don't share discipline information with unauthorized people
- Don't discuss one employee's record with other employees
- Keep screens private when viewing sensitive data
