### Recommended Actions

Based on point thresholds, the system displays recommended actions:

|--------|---------|
| No Action | Below first threshold |
| Verbal Warning | First threshold reached |
| Written Warning | Second threshold reached |
| Final Warning | Third threshold reached |
| Termination | Maximum threshold reached |

<Note>
These thresholds are configured in Organization Settings under Discipline Actions. Your organization may have different action names or thresholds.
