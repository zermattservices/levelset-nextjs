# Discipline Dashboard

The Discipline Dashboard provides a structured system for documenting infractions, tracking progressive discipline, and ensuring consistent accountability across your team.

## How It Works

### Infractions

Infractions are documented incidents where a team member violated a policy or expectation. Each infraction has:

- **Type** - The category of infraction (e.g., Tardiness, No Call No Show)
- **Point Value** - A numerical value that contributes to the total
- **Date** - When the incident occurred
- **Notes** - Details about the specific situation

### Point System

Infractions accumulate points over time. Your organization defines:

- **Infraction Types** - What infractions can be documented
- **Point Values** - How many points each type is worth
- **Action Thresholds** - What actions are triggered at certain point totals

### Progressive Discipline

As points accumulate, the system recommends progressive actions:

| Points | Typical Action |
|--------|----------------|
| 3 | Verbal Warning |
| 6 | Written Warning |
| 9 | Final Warning |
| 12 | Termination |

<Note>
Your organization may have different thresholds and actions configured. Check Organization Settings for your specific policy.
</Note>
