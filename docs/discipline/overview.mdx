# Discipline Dashboard

The Discipline Dashboard helps you document infractions, track points, and follow a consistent progressive discipline process.

## How Discipline Tracking Works

### The Point System

When you document an infraction, it adds points to the employee's record:

1. Each infraction type has a **point value** (set by your organization)
2. Points **accumulate** over time
3. When points reach certain **thresholds**, the system recommends actions

### Progressive Discipline

As points build up, recommended actions become more serious:

| Point Level | Typical Action |
|-------------|----------------|
| Low | Verbal coaching |
| Medium | Written warning |
| High | Final warning |
| Maximum | Termination review |

<Note>
Your organization configures the specific point thresholds and action names. The levels above are examples.
</Note>

## Viewing the Discipline Dashboard

### How to Access

Click **Discipline** in the navigation menu.

### What You'll See

The dashboard shows two main sections:

**Recommended Actions**
- Employees who have reached a threshold
- The recommended action for each person
- Quick access to take action

**All Employees**
- Everyone on your roster
- Their current point totals
- Recent infractions

### Employee Details

Click on any employee to see:
- Complete infraction history
- Dates and details of each incident
- Actions that have been taken
- Current point total

## Understanding the Display

### Point Totals

The number shown is the sum of all infraction points. Some things to know:

- Points may expire after a certain period (if configured)
- Different infraction types are worth different points
- The total determines recommended actions

### Status Indicators

Look for visual indicators showing:

- **No action needed** - Below the first threshold
- **Action recommended** - At or above a threshold
- **Recent activity** - Has new infractions

### Infraction Details

Each infraction record includes:
- Type of infraction
- Date it occurred
- Point value
- Who documented it
- Notes about what happened

## Taking Action

When an employee reaches a threshold:

1. Review their complete infraction history
2. Verify the recommended action is appropriate
3. Have a conversation with the employee
4. Document the action you took

<Warning>
Always review the full context before taking disciplinary action. The system provides recommendations, but you make the final decision.
</Warning>

## Who Can Access Discipline

Access to the Discipline Dashboard depends on your role:

| Permission | Who Has It |
|------------|------------|
| View all records | Operators, Leadership |
| Submit infractions | Roles with discipline access |
| Configure settings | Operators, Admins |

Your organization configures exactly who can see and submit discipline records in the Discipline Access settings.
