# Submitting Infractions

When a team member violates a policy or expectation, document it as an infraction in Levelset. This guide walks through the process.

## Before You Submit

<Warning>
Only document infractions that have been addressed with the team member. The infraction record should reflect a conversation that has already happened.
</Warning>

### Consider

- Has the behavior been clearly communicated as an expectation?
- Did you address the issue directly with the team member?
- Is this the appropriate infraction type for what occurred?

## Accessing the Infraction Form

### Via Mobile PWA

1. Open the Levelset PWA
2. Navigate to the discipline section
3. Tap **Submit Infraction** or the add button

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to the Discipline Dashboard
2. Click **Add Infraction** or find the employee and add from their record

## Submitting an Infraction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Employee">
    Choose the team member who committed the infraction from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Infraction Type">
    Choose the type of infraction from the list configured by your organization. Common types include:
    - Tardiness
    - No Call No Show
    - Uniform Violation
    - Policy Violation
    - Insubordination
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Date">
    Select the date the infraction occurred. This should be the actual date of the incident, not today's date (unless they're the same).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Notes">
    Provide specific details about what happened:
    - What exactly occurred?
    - When did it happen?
    - Were there witnesses?
    - What was said in the conversation with the team member?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Review the information and submit. The infraction will be added to the employee's record.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Password Protection

Your organization may require a password to submit infractions. This adds a layer of accountability. Enter the discipline password when prompted.

<Tip>
If you don't know the discipline password, check with your administrator or look in Organization Settings under Discipline Access.
</Tip>

## Writing Good Notes

Effective infraction notes are:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Include exact times, locations, and behaviors. "Arrived at 2:15pm for 2:00pm shift" not "Was late."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Factual" icon="check">
    Describe what happened, not your interpretation. Avoid emotional language.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Complete" icon="list-check">
    Include relevant context that might be important later.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Professional" icon="briefcase">
    Write as if the note might be read in a formal setting.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Notes

<Accordion title="Good Example">
"Team member arrived at 2:15pm for scheduled 2:00pm shift. This is the third late arrival this month. Discussed importance of punctuality and impact on team. Team member acknowledged and committed to arriving on time."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Poor Example">
"Late again. Talked to them about it."
</Accordion>

## After Submitting

Once submitted:

- The infraction appears in the employee's discipline history
- Points are added to their total
- The system may recommend a disciplinary action based on thresholds
- Leadership can view the infraction in the dashboard

## Following Up

After documenting an infraction, consider:

1. **Check the recommended action** - Has the employee reached a threshold requiring formal action?
2. **Document the action** - If a warning is given, record it
3. **Follow up** - Monitor for improvement or repeated issues

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I selected the wrong infraction type">
    Contact your administrator to have the infraction corrected or removed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't find an infraction type">
    The available types are configured in Organization Settings. Ask your administrator to add the type if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The password isn't working">
    Verify you're entering the correct discipline password. Check with your administrator if you're unsure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
