# How to Submit an Infraction

This guide explains how to properly document a discipline infraction in Levelset.

## Before You Document

### Talk to the Employee First

<Warning>
Always address the issue with the employee before documenting. The infraction record should document a conversation that already happened.
</Warning>

Before submitting an infraction, you should have:
- Spoken directly with the employee about the incident
- Explained what policy was violated
- Given them a chance to respond
- Clarified expectations going forward

### Choose the Right Infraction Type

Your organization has defined specific infraction types. Common examples include:

- Tardiness
- Absence without notice
- Uniform violation
- Policy violation
- Safety violation

Make sure you select the type that accurately describes what happened.

## How to Submit an Infraction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Infraction Form">
    You can submit infractions from:
    - The Discipline Dashboard (click Add Infraction)
    - The mobile app
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the Employee">
    Choose the team member from the dropdown list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the Infraction Type">
    Pick the type that best matches what happened. Each type has a point value that will be added to their total.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter the Date">
    Select the date the incident occurred. This should be the actual date of the incident, not necessarily today.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write Detailed Notes">
    Document what happened. Be specific and factual.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Review everything and submit. You may need to enter a password if your organization requires it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Good Notes

The notes you write become part of the permanent record. Good documentation is:

### Specific

**Good**: "Arrived at 2:15 PM for a 2:00 PM scheduled shift (15 minutes late)"  
**Bad**: "Was late again"

### Factual

**Good**: "Employee was on personal phone call during service, did not respond to guest for approximately 2 minutes"  
**Bad**: "Employee doesn't care about guests"

### Complete

Include relevant context:
- What exactly happened
- When and where it occurred
- Who was involved or witnessed it
- What was said in your conversation with the employee

### Professional

Write as if this note might be read by HR, lawyers, or the employee themselves. Keep it objective and avoid emotional language.

## Example Notes

<Accordion title="Good Example - Tardiness">
"Employee arrived at 2:15 PM for scheduled 2:00 PM shift. This is the third late arrival in the past two weeks. When asked about the tardiness, employee explained traffic was bad. Reviewed importance of arriving on time and the impact on the team. Employee acknowledged and committed to leaving earlier for future shifts."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Good Example - Policy Violation">
"During dinner rush, observed employee eating fries from the food line. When addressed, employee stated they were 'just checking quality.' Reviewed policy that team members may not eat food from the line. Employee understood and apologized."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bad Example">
"Late again. Third time this month. Talked to them."

*This lacks specific times, dates, and details about the conversation.*
</Accordion>

## Password Protection

Your organization may require a password to submit infractions. This ensures accountability.

- Enter the password when prompted
- If you don't know it, check with your administrator
- The password is configured in Organization Settings

## What Happens After You Submit

1. **Points are added** to the employee's total
2. **The system checks** if they've reached a threshold
3. **The infraction appears** in their discipline history
4. **Recommended actions** are updated if a threshold was reached

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I selected the wrong infraction type">
    Contact your administrator. Infractions can be corrected if there was an error.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The infraction type I need doesn't exist">
    Infraction types are configured in Organization Settings. Ask your administrator to add the type you need.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The password isn't working">
    Double-check you're entering it correctly. The discipline form password is set in Organization Settings → Discipline Access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="An employee isn't showing in the list">
    Make sure they're marked as Active in the roster and assigned to your location.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After Documenting

Follow up appropriately:

1. **Check the recommended action** - Has the employee reached a new threshold?
2. **Take action if needed** - Deliver verbal/written warnings as recommended
3. **Document the action** - Record that you delivered the warning
4. **Monitor going forward** - Watch for improvement or repeated issues
