# Positional Excellence

Positional Excellence lets you rate team members on how well they perform in specific positions. Use it to identify strengths, track progress, and guide development.

## How It Works

### Positions

A position is a specific job someone does, like:

- **Front of House (FOH)**: Register, Drive-Thru, Dining Room, Drinks
- **Back of House (BOH)**: Grill, Prep, Fries, Expeditor

Your organization defines which positions exist and what they're called.

### Rating Criteria

Each position has **5 criteria** that define what good performance looks like. For example, a Register position might be rated on:

1. Speed
2. Accuracy
3. Guest Interaction
4. Menu Knowledge
5. Payment Handling

### Rating Scale

When you rate someone, you score each criterion from 1-3:

| Score | Label | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **1** | Not Yet | Still learning, needs improvement |
| **2** | On the Rise | Making progress, getting better |
| **3** | Crushing It | Consistently excellent |

## Viewing Ratings

### How to Access

1. Click **Positional Excellence** in the navigation menu
2. The dashboard shows all employees with their ratings

### What You'll See

The main table shows:

- **Employee name and role**
- **Average rating** across all criteria
- **Color indicator** (red/yellow/green based on performance)

Click the arrow next to any employee to expand and see their detailed ratings.

### Switching Views

Use the tabs at the top to change what you see:

| Tab | What It Shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Overview** | All employees with summary ratings |
| **Employee Ratings** | Detailed breakdown by position |
| **Leadership View** | Ratings organized by who submitted them |

### Filtering

- Use the **FOH/BOH toggle** to show only front or back of house positions
- Use the **search box** to find specific employees
- Use **position dropdowns** to focus on one position

## Understanding the Colors

Ratings are color-coded to make it easy to spot performance levels at a glance:

- 🟢 **Green** - Crushing It (high performer)
- 🟡 **Yellow** - On the Rise (developing)
- 🔴 **Red** - Not Yet (needs attention)

The specific score thresholds for each color are configured in your organization settings.

## Rolling Averages

Levelset calculates averages based on the **last 4 ratings** for each position. This means:

- Recent performance is weighted more heavily
- One bad day doesn't ruin someone's score
- Improvement shows up quickly in the numbers

## Classic View

For a spreadsheet-style view of ratings:

1. Click **Go to Classic View** on the Positional Excellence page
2. Or navigate directly to `/positional-excellence-classic`

The classic view is great for:
- Printing for meetings
- Displaying on a screen
- Quick visual comparison across the team
