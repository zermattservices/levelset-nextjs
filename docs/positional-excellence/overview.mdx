# Positional Excellence

Positional Excellence is at the heart of Levelset. It provides a structured way to rate team members on their performance in specific positions, track progress over time, and identify development opportunities.

## How It Works

### Positions

Each location has a set of positions that team members can work (e.g., iPOS, Host, Breading, Fries). Positions are typically divided into:

- **FOH (Front of House)** - Customer-facing roles like iPOS, Host, Drinks, Bagging
- **BOH (Back of House)** - Kitchen roles like Primary, Secondary, Machines, Breading, Fries

### Rating Criteria

Each position has 5 rating criteria (sometimes called "Big 5") that define what excellence looks like in that role. For example, an iPOS position might be rated on:

1. Speed
2. Accuracy
3. Guest Interaction
4. Order Knowledge
5. Payment Handling

Your organization can customize these criteria in Organization Settings.

### Rating Scale

Team members are rated on a 1-3 scale for each criterion:

| Rating | Label | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not Yet | Still developing in this area |
| 2 | On the Rise | Making progress, approaching proficiency |
| 3 | Crushing It | Consistently excellent performance |

The thresholds for these labels can be customized by your organization.

## Dashboard Views

The Positional Excellence dashboard offers three main views:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    Shows all employees with their average ratings across positions. 
    
    - See at-a-glance performance across your team
    - Expand rows to see the last 4 individual ratings
    - Toggle between FOH and BOH views
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Employee Ratings">

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Rating Averages

Levelset calculates rolling averages based on the last 4 ratings for each position. This provides a balanced view that:

- Reflects recent performance
- Smooths out one-off variations
- Shows meaningful trends over time

## Color Coding

Ratings are color-coded for quick visual reference:

- 🟢 **Green** - Crushing It (meeting threshold)
- 🟡 **Yellow** - On the Rise (approaching threshold)
- 🔴 **Red** - Not Yet (below threshold)
