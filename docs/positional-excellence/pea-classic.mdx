# PEA Classic View

The PEA Classic view provides a traditional spreadsheet-style view of positional ratings, similar to the original Google Sheets implementation.

## Accessing PEA Classic

### From the Dashboard

Navigate to **Positional Excellence** and look for the "PEA Classic" option or link.

### From the Mobile PWA

The mobile app includes a link to view the PEA Classic page for your location.

### Direct URL

Access directly at `/positional-excellence-classic` on your Levelset domain.

## What You'll See

The PEA Classic view displays:

### Rating Grid

A spreadsheet-style grid showing:

- **Rows** - Each team member
- **Columns** - Rating criteria for the selected position
- **Cells** - Individual ratings with color coding

### Color Scale

Ratings are displayed with a color gradient based on your organization's thresholds:

| Color | Rating Range | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Green | Above upper threshold | Crushing It |
| Yellow | Between thresholds | On the Rise |
| Red | Below lower threshold | Not Yet |

The specific threshold values are configured in Organization Settings under Rating Scale.
