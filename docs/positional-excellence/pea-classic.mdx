# Classic View

The Classic View shows positional ratings in a spreadsheet-style format. It's great for printing, displaying on screens, and quick visual comparisons.

## How to Access Classic View

**Option 1: From the Dashboard**
1. Go to **Positional Excellence**
2. Click **Go to Classic View**

**Option 2: Direct URL**
Navigate to `/positional-excellence-classic` in your browser.

## What You'll See

The Classic View displays a grid with:

- **Rows** = Team members
- **Columns** = The 5 rating criteria for the selected position
- **Cells** = Average rating for each criterion (color-coded)

### Color Coding

Each cell is colored based on the rating:

| Color | Meaning | Score Range |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 🟢 Green | Crushing It | High scores |
| 🟡 Yellow | On the Rise | Middle scores |
| 🔴 Red | Not Yet | Low scores |

The exact thresholds are configured in your organization's Rating Scale settings.

## Using the Controls

### Select a Position

Use the dropdown at the top to choose which position to view. The grid updates to show ratings for that position.

### Toggle FOH/BOH

Use the toggle to switch between:
- **FOH** - Front of House positions only
- **BOH** - Back of House positions only

### View Options

- **Expand/collapse rows** to see more or less detail
- **Scroll horizontally** if there are many criteria columns
