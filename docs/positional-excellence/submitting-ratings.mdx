# How to Submit Ratings

This guide shows you how to submit positional ratings for your team members.

## Before You Start

### Who Can Submit Ratings?

Your ability to submit ratings depends on your role:

- **Leadership roles** can typically rate any position
- **Supervisory roles** can rate positions they oversee
- **Role mapping** in settings determines exactly who can rate what

If you can't see a position in the rating form, check with your administrator about your role permissions.

### When to Rate

Rate team members when you observe them working in a position. Good times include:

- During or after a shift you supervised
- After watching them handle a rush period
- When you notice significant improvement or issues

<Tip>
Rate regularly! The more data points, the more accurate the averages become.
</Tip>

## How to Submit a Rating

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Rating Form">
    Access the rating form through the mobile app or by navigating to the ratings submission page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the Position">
    Choose which position you're rating from the dropdown. You'll see a description of the position to confirm you selected the right one.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the Employee">
    Choose the team member you're rating. Only employees assigned to work in that area (FOH or BOH) will appear.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rate Each Criterion">
    For each of the 5 criteria:
    
    1. Read the criterion name and description
    2. Think about specific examples you observed
    3. Select your rating:
       - **1 (Not Yet)** - Still developing this skill
       - **2 (On the Rise)** - Making progress
       - **3 (Crushing It)** - Consistently excellent
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Review your ratings and click **Submit**. The rating is saved immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rating Guidelines

### Be Consistent

Apply the same standards to everyone. A "3" should mean the same thing for every team member.

**Ask yourself**: If two people performed identically, would I rate them the same?

### Be Specific

Base your rating on specific behaviors you observed, not general feelings about the person.

**Instead of**: "They're a good worker"  
**Think about**: "Did they complete orders quickly? Were they accurate? Did they engage with guests?"

### Use the Full Scale

Don't default to all 2s. Give 1s when performance needs work and 3s when it's truly excellent.

- **1** = They're not meeting expectations yet
- **2** = They're doing okay, room to grow
- **3** = They're exceeding expectations

### Rate What You Saw

Only rate based on what you actually observed. If you didn't see someone work in a position recently, don't rate them.

## Common Situations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The employee is having a bad day">
    Rate what you observed. One lower rating won't significantly impact their average because Levelset uses rolling averages of the last 4 ratings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I want to change a rating I submitted">
    You can't edit submitted ratings. If you made a significant error, contact your administrator.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="An employee isn't appearing in the list">
    Check that:
    - They're assigned to the correct FOH/BOH area
    - They're marked as Active in the roster
    - You're looking at the right position
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't see a position I should be able to rate">
    Your role may not have permission for that position. Check with your administrator about Role Mapping settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Happens After You Submit

- The rating is saved immediately
- It's included in the employee's rolling average (last 4 ratings)
- It appears in the Positional Excellence dashboard
- Leadership can see all submitted ratings
