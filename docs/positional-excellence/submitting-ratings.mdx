# Submitting Ratings

Leaders can submit positional ratings for team members through the mobile PWA. This guide explains the rating process.

## Who Can Submit Ratings

Rating permissions are based on your role and position mappings:

- **Operator** - Can rate all positions
- **Executive/Director** - Can rate all positions
- **Team Lead/Trainer** - Can rate positions assigned to their role in Organization Settings

Check with your administrator if you're unsure which positions you can rate.

## Accessing the Rating Form

### Via Mobile PWA

1. Open the Levelset PWA on your mobile device
2. Tap **Submit Rating** or navigate to the ratings section
3. You'll see the rating form

### Via QR Code

Your location may have QR codes posted that link directly to the rating form.

## Submitting a Rating

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Position">
    Choose the position you're rating from the dropdown. You'll see a brief description of the position to confirm you've selected the right one.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Employee">
    Choose the team member you're rating. Only active employees assigned to the selected position area (FOH/BOH) will appear.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rate Each Criterion">
    For each of the 5 rating criteria:
    - Read the criterion name and description
    - Select a rating: **Not Yet (1)**, **On the Rise (2)**, or **Crushing It (3)**
    - Consider specific examples of the team member's performance
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Review your ratings and tap **Submit**. The rating will be saved and included in the team member's rolling average.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Be Consistent" icon="scale-balanced">
    Apply the same standards across all team members. A "Crushing It" should mean the same thing for everyone.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rate Regularly" icon="calendar">
    Submit ratings frequently to build a meaningful picture of performance over time.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Think about specific examples of behavior when rating. What did you actually observe?
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use the Full Scale" icon="chart-line">
    Don't hesitate to give 1s or 3s when appropriate. Honest ratings drive real development.

## Rating Criteria Descriptions

Each criterion has a description that explains what excellence looks like. Read these carefully when rating:

<Tip>
The criterion description appears below the criterion name in the rating form. Use it as a guide for what to look for.
</Tip>

## After Submitting

Once submitted:

- The rating is immediately saved to the database
- It's included in the team member's rolling average (last 4 ratings)
- It appears in the Positional Excellence dashboard
- Leadership can see who submitted ratings in the Leadership View
