# Managing Roles

Roles in Levelset determine what employees can see and do. This guide explains how roles work and how to change them.

## Understanding the Role Hierarchy

Roles are organized from highest to lowest permission level. A typical hierarchy might look like:

```
Operator (highest)
    ↓
Director/Executive
    ↓
Supervisor/Lead
    ↓
Trainer
    ↓
Team Member
    ↓
New Hire (lowest)
```

<Note>
Your organization may have different role names. What matters is the hierarchy level, not the specific name.
</Note>

### Why Hierarchy Matters

- Higher roles have more permissions
- You can only change roles for people **below** your level
- Dashboard access is typically limited to higher levels
- Role determines what positions someone can rate

## How to Change Someone's Role

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Roster">
    Click **Roster** in the navigation menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find the Employee">
    Locate the person whose role you want to change. Use the search box if needed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Their Role Badge">
    Click on the colored role badge next to their name.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the New Role">
    Choose the new role from the dropdown. You'll only see roles that you have permission to assign.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The change saves automatically. The new role takes effect immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can and Can't Do

### You CAN:
- Change roles for employees below your level
- Promote someone to a level below yours
- Demote someone to any lower level

### You CANNOT:
- Change your own role
- Promote someone to your level or above
- Change roles for people at or above your level

### Example

If you're a **Director** (Level 2):
- ✅ You can change a Team Member to Trainer
- ✅ You can change a Trainer to Team Member
- ❌ You cannot make someone a Director
- ❌ You cannot change another Director's role

## Role Changes and Dashboard Access

Changing someone's role does **NOT** automatically give them dashboard access.

If someone needs to log into Levelset:
1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Users**
2. Add them as a user
3. They'll receive login credentials

See [Users documentation](/organization-settings/users) for details.

## Role Changes and Ratings

When you change someone's role, their ability to submit ratings may change:

- **Promotion** might give them access to rate more positions
- **Demotion** might limit which positions they can rate
- Role Mapping settings determine exactly who can rate what

## When to Change Roles

### Promotions

Change someone's role when they:
- Take on new responsibilities
- Complete a development program
- Move into a supervisory position

### Demotions

Role changes down may happen when:
- Responsibilities are reduced
- Someone steps back from a leadership role
- Performance issues require a change

### Corrections

Change roles if:
- Someone was initially assigned the wrong role
- The role structure has been updated

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Communicate First" icon="comments">
    Tell the person before changing their role, especially for promotions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Consistent" icon="scale-balanced">
    Apply the same criteria for role changes across your team
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Why" icon="file-lines">
    Keep notes on why role changes were made
  </Card>
  <Card title="Check Access" icon="key">
    After a promotion, verify they have the system access they need

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't change someone's role">
    They're probably at or above your level in the hierarchy. Only people below your level can have their roles changed by you.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The role I want isn't in the dropdown">
    You can only assign roles below your own level. If you need to assign a higher role, ask someone with more permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="They were promoted but can't access the dashboard">
    Role changes don't automatically grant login access. Add them as a user in Organization Settings → Users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Their role changed but they can't rate positions they should">
    Check the Role Mapping settings in Organization Settings → Positional Excellence to ensure their new role has access to the right positions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
