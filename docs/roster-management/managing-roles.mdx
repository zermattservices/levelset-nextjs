# Managing Roles

Roles in Levelset determine what employees can access and do within the platform. This guide covers how to manage role assignments.

## Understanding the Role Hierarchy

Roles are organized in a hierarchy from highest to lowest permission level:

```
Operator (Level 0)
    ↓
Executive (Level 1)
    ↓
Director (Level 2)
    ↓
Team Lead (Level 3)
    ↓
Trainer (Level 4)
    ↓
Team Member (Level 5)
    ↓
New Hire (Level 6)
```

<Note>
Your organization may have different role names. The hierarchy is what matters for permissions.
</Note>

## Changing an Employee's Role

### From the Roster

1. Navigate to **Roster**
2. Find the employee in the table
3. Click on their current role badge
4. Select the new role from the dropdown
5. The change saves automatically

### Who Can Change Roles

Role changes follow a hierarchy rule:

- You can only change roles for employees below your level
- You cannot promote someone to your level or above
- Operators can change any role
- Levelset Admins have full access

## Role Permissions

Each role level has different capabilities:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Operator">
    - Full access to all features
    - Can manage all settings
    - Can change any employee's role
    - Can access all locations in the organization
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Executive/Director">
    - View and submit ratings
    - Access discipline dashboard
    - Manage team members below their level
    - Access organization settings (limited)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Team Lead">
    - Submit ratings for assigned positions
    - View team performance data
    - Limited discipline access (if enabled)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Trainer">
    - Submit ratings for positions they train
    - View relevant performance data
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Team Member/New Hire">
    - Mobile app access (if enabled)
    - View own performance data (if enabled)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dashboard Access

Not all roles have access to the Levelset dashboard:

| Role Level | Dashboard Access |
|------------|------------------|
| 0-2 (Operator to Director) | Full dashboard access |
| 3+ (Team Lead and below) | Limited or no dashboard access |

To give someone dashboard access:
1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Users**
2. Click **Add User**
3. Select the employee and create their login

## Role Colors

Each role has an assigned color for visual identification:

- Colors appear on role badges throughout the platform
- Customize colors in **Organization Settings** → **Roles**
- Drag rows to reorder the hierarchy
- Click the color circle to change a role's color

## Promoting Employees

When promoting an employee:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update their role">
    Change their role in the roster to reflect their new position.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider dashboard access">
    If they need dashboard access, add them as a user in Organization Settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review position permissions">
    Check Role Mapping in Organization Settings to ensure they can rate appropriate positions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating New Roles

If your organization needs additional roles:

1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Roles**
2. Click **Add Role**
3. Enter the role name
4. Drag to position in the hierarchy
5. Select a color

<Warning>
Adding new roles affects permissions across the platform. Coordinate with your team before making changes.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Regular Reviews" icon="calendar-check">
    Review role assignments periodically to ensure they reflect current responsibilities.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Clear Criteria" icon="list-check">
    Define what each role means in your organization so promotions are consistent.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Document Changes" icon="file-lines">
    Keep notes on why role changes were made, especially for promotions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Train on Access" icon="graduation-cap">
    When someone is promoted, ensure they understand their new access and responsibilities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't change an employee's role">
    Check that:
    - The employee is at a lower level than you
    - You're not trying to promote them to or above your level
    - You have the appropriate permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="New role isn't showing the right permissions">
    Role permissions may need to be configured. Check Organization Settings → Role Mapping for position access, and ensure dashboard users are set up correctly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Employee can't access the dashboard after promotion">
    Changing someone's role doesn't automatically give dashboard access. You need to add them as a user in Organization Settings → Users.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
