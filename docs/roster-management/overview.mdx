| FOH/BOH | Front of House or Back of House assignment |
| Hire Date | When they started |
| Status | Active, inactive, or other status |
| Availability | Full-time, part-time, limited |

### Tabs

The roster is organized into tabs:

- **Active** - Currently employed team members
- **Pending Evaluations** - Employees awaiting certification or review (if enabled)
- **PIP** - Employees on performance improvement plans (if enabled)

<Note>

| Operator | Business owner/operator with full access |
| Executive | Senior leadership |
| Director | Department or area leadership |
| Team Lead | Shift or team supervision |
| Trainer | Training responsibilities |
| Team Member | Standard team member |
| New Hire | Recently hired, in training |

Your organization can customize role names and hierarchy in Organization Settings.

## Role Colors

Each role has an assigned color that appears throughout the platform:

- Color-coded badges make it easy to identify roles at a glance
- Colors are configured in Organization Settings under Roles
- Consistent coloring across all dashboards and views
