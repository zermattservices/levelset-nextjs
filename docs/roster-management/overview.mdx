# Roster Management

The Roster page is where you manage employee information, roles, and status. Keep your roster up to date so ratings and other features work correctly.

## Accessing the Roster

Click **Roster** in the navigation menu to view your team.

## What You'll See

The roster displays all employees in a table with key information:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Name | Employee's full name |
| Role | Their position in the organization hierarchy |
| FOH/BOH | Whether they work Front of House, Back of House, or both |
| Hire Date | When they started |
| Status | Active or inactive |

## Key Actions

### From the Roster Page

You can:
- **View** all employees at your location
- **Search** for specific people
- **Filter** by FOH/BOH
- **Edit** employee details
- **Change roles** for employees below your level

### Quick Edits

Click on an employee row to:
- Update their information
- Change their role
- Modify their FOH/BOH assignment
- View their details

## Understanding the Table

### Sorting

Click column headers to sort by:
- Name (alphabetical)
- Role (by hierarchy level)
- Hire date (newest or oldest first)

### Role Badges

Each employee shows their role with a colored badge. Colors are assigned by your organization to make roles easy to identify at a glance.

### FOH/BOH Indicators

- **FOH** = Front of House (customer-facing positions)
- **BOH** = Back of House (kitchen/production positions)
- **Both** = Works in both areas

This assignment affects which positions they appear in for ratings.

## Who Can Manage the Roster

Your ability to edit the roster depends on your role:

| Your Role | What You Can Do |
|-----------|----------------|
| Operator | Full access to all employees |
| Leadership | Edit employees below your level |
| Supervisor | Limited editing for your team |

### The Hierarchy Rule

You can only change roles for people **below your level** in the hierarchy. You cannot:
- Promote someone to your same level
- Promote someone above your level
- Change roles for people at or above your level

## Keeping the Roster Updated

### Why It Matters

An accurate roster ensures:
- Ratings go to the right people
- Discipline records are for current employees
- Reports and metrics are accurate
- Role-based permissions work correctly

### Regular Maintenance

- **Add** new hires when they start
- **Update** roles when people are promoted
- **Change status** when people leave
- **Correct** FOH/BOH assignments as needed
