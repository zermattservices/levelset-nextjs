# Adding Employees

When someone new joins your team, add them to Levelset so they can be included in ratings, discipline tracking, and reports.

## How to Add an Employee

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Roster">
    Click **Roster** in the navigation menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Employee">
    Look for the **Add Employee** button (usually at the top of the page).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Their Information">
    Fill in the required fields:
    
    **Required:**
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Role (their position in the hierarchy)
    
    **Optional but recommended:**
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Hire date
    - FOH/BOH assignment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** or **Add** to create the employee record.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing the Right Role

When adding someone, select the role that matches their position:

| Starting Role | Use For |
|--------------|---------|
| New Hire | Just started, still in training |
| Team Member | Completed initial training |
| Trainer | Has training responsibilities |
| Supervisor/Lead | Has supervisory responsibilities |

<Tip>
Start people at the appropriate level for their experience. You can always change their role later as they develop.
</Tip>

## Setting FOH/BOH

Choose based on where the person primarily works:

- **FOH (Front of House)** - Customer-facing roles
- **BOH (Back of House)** - Kitchen and production roles
- **Both** - If they work in both areas

This setting determines:
- Which positions they appear in for ratings
- How they're filtered in various views

## What Happens After Adding

Once you add an employee:

1. They appear in the roster immediately
2. They can receive positional ratings
3. They can have discipline records created
4. They show up in reports and analytics

## If You Use Automated Sync

Your organization may sync employees automatically from:
- HotSchedules
- Your payroll system
- Other HR software

If automatic sync is enabled:
- New employees may appear automatically
- Some information may sync from the other system
- Ask your administrator about what's automated

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I accidentally created a duplicate">
    Contact your administrator to merge or remove the duplicate record.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I selected the wrong role">
    No problem! You can edit the employee's role from the roster. See [Managing Roles](/roster-management/managing-roles).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The new employee isn't showing up in ratings">
    Check that:
    - They have the correct FOH/BOH assignment
    - Their status is Active
    - You've selected the right location
    - They've been added to your location's roster
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't find the Add Employee button">
    You may not have permission to add employees. Check with your administrator about your role permissions.
  </Accordion>

## Information You Can Add Later

Not everything needs to be filled in right away. You can always go back and add:

- Email address
- Phone number
- Updated role (when promoted)
- FOH/BOH changes
- Other details

Just click on the employee in the roster to edit their information.
