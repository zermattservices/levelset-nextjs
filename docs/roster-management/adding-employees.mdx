    Navigate to **Roster** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Employee">
    Look for the **Add Employee** button, typically at the top of the roster table.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Employee Information">
    Fill in the required fields:
    - **First Name** - Employee's first name

## Required vs. Optional Fields

### Required

### Optional

- Email address

- FOH/BOH assignment (may default based on role)

## Role Selection

When adding a new employee, consider:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="New Hire" icon="seedling">
    Just starting, still in training. Limited to basic permissions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Team Member" icon="user">
    Completed initial training. Standard team member permissions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Start employees at an appropriate level for their experience. You can always update their role as they progress.
</Tip>

## FOH/BOH Assignment

Assign employees to the area where they primarily work:

- **FOH (Front of House)** - Guest-facing positions like iPOS, Host, Drinks
- **BOH (Back of House)** - Kitchen positions like Primary, Breading, Fries
- **Both** - Some employees may work in both areas

This assignment affects:
- Which positions they appear in for ratings
- Default filters in various views
- Reporting and analytics

## Bulk Import

For adding multiple employees at once:

1. Check if your organization has bulk import enabled
2. Download the employee template
3. Fill in employee information
4. Upload the completed file

Contact your administrator for bulk import instructions specific to your organization.

## After Adding

Once an employee is added:

- They appear in the roster and all relevant views
- They can receive positional ratings
- They can be included in discipline records if needed
- They appear in reports and analytics

## Syncing with Other Systems

If your organization uses:

- **HotSchedules** - Employees may sync automatically
- **Payroll systems** - Data may import from your provider

Ask your administrator about automated sync options.
