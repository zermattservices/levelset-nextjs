# Introduction to Levelset

This guide explains the key concepts you need to understand before using Levelset.

## How Levelset Is Organized

### Organizations and Locations

Levelset uses a two-level structure:

- **Organization** - Your company (you might have one or several locations)
- **Location** - An individual restaurant or site within your organization

When you log in, you'll select which location you want to work with. Settings configured at the organization level apply to all locations.

### Your Role

Your role determines what you can see and do in Levelset. Common roles include:

| Role Type | What You Can Do |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Owner/Operator** | Full access to everything |
| **Leadership** | Submit ratings, manage discipline, view reports |
| **Supervisor** | Submit ratings for positions you oversee |
| **Team Member** | Limited access (mobile features only) |

<Note>
Your organization may use different role names. The permission level is what matters.

## The Four Main Features

### 1. Positional Excellence

Rate team members on how well they perform in specific positions (like "Drive-Thru" or "Kitchen").

- Points accumulate and trigger recommended actions
- Everything is documented for consistency

Keep your employee list up to date.
