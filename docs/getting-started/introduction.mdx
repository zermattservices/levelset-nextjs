# Introduction to Levelset

This guide will help you understand the core concepts of Levelset and how to navigate the platform effectively.

## Core Concepts

### Organizations and Locations

Levelset is organized into a hierarchy:

- **Organization** - Your company or franchise group (e.g., "Reece Howard Organization")
- **Locations** - Individual restaurants within your organization (e.g., "CFA Buda", "CFA West Buda")

Settings and configurations can be managed at the organization level and apply to all locations.

### Roles and Permissions

Levelset uses a role-based system to control access:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Operator** | Full access to all features and settings |
| **Executive/Director** | Leadership access with management capabilities |
| **Team Lead** | Can submit ratings and view team data |
| **Trainer** | Can submit ratings for positions they train |
| **Team Member** | Limited access (primarily for mobile features) |

Your organization can customize role names and the hierarchy to match your structure.
