# Getting Started

Before you dive in, it helps to understand how Levelset is organized. This guide explains the key concepts and how they work together.

## Organizations and Locations

Levelset uses a two-level structure:

```
Organization (your company)
    ├── Location 1
    ├── Location 2
    └── Location 3
```

### Organization

An **organization** is your company or franchise group. It's the top level of Levelset.

- All your locations belong to one organization
- Settings like positions, rating criteria, and roles are configured at the organization level
- These settings apply to all locations

### Location

A **location** is an individual site (restaurant, store, etc.) within your organization.

- Each location has its own employees
- Ratings and discipline are tracked per location
- When you log in, you select which location you want to work with

<Note>
If you only have one location, you won't need to select anything—you'll go straight to the dashboard.
</Note>

### Switching Locations

If you have access to multiple locations:

1. Look for the **location dropdown** in the navigation bar
2. Click it to see your available locations
3. Select a different location
4. All data on the page updates to show that location

Your selection stays as you navigate between pages until you change it.

## Employees vs Users

These two concepts are different in Levelset:

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Employee** | Someone on your roster who works at your location |
| **User** | Someone who can log into the Levelset dashboard |

### Employees

Every team member at your location should be in the roster as an **employee**. This allows them to:

- Receive positional ratings
- Have discipline records (if applicable)
- Appear in reports and analytics

Most employees don't need to log into Levelset—they're just tracked in the system.

### Users

A **user** is someone with login credentials for the dashboard. Users are typically:

- Operators and owners
- Directors and managers
- Supervisors who need to view reports

To become a user, someone must be added in **Organization Settings → Users**. Simply being an employee doesn't grant dashboard access.

<Tip>
Think of it this way: All users are usually employees, but most employees are not users.
</Tip>

## Roles and Permission Levels

Roles control what people can see and do in Levelset. They're organized in a hierarchy.

### The Role Hierarchy

Roles go from highest permissions (top) to lowest (bottom):

```
Level 0: Operator/Owner (full access)
    ↓
Level 1: Director/Executive
    ↓
Level 2: Manager
    ↓
Level 3: Supervisor/Team Lead
    ↓
Level 4: Trainer
    ↓
Level 5: Team Member
    ↓
Level 6: New Hire
```

<Note>
Your organization can rename these roles to match your terminology. What matters is the level number, not the name.
</Note>

### What Roles Control

| Permission | Determined By |
|------------|---------------|
| **Dashboard access** | Typically levels 0-2 (must also be added as a User) |
| **What you can see** | Your role level |
| **Who you can manage** | You can only manage people below your level |
| **What positions you can rate** | Role Mapping settings |
| **Discipline access** | Discipline Access settings |

### The Hierarchy Rule

A key rule in Levelset: **You can only manage people below your level.**

- A Manager (Level 2) can change roles for Team Leads (Level 3) and below
- A Manager cannot change roles for other Managers or Directors
- Only Operators have unrestricted access

### Role Colors

Each role has a color assigned for quick visual identification. You'll see these color-coded badges throughout Levelset—on the roster, in reports, and in rating views.

## FOH and BOH

Employees and positions are categorized as:

- **FOH (Front of House)** - Customer-facing roles
- **BOH (Back of House)** - Kitchen/production roles

### Why This Matters

| What | How FOH/BOH Affects It |
|------|------------------------|
| **Employees** | Determines which positions they can be rated on |
| **Positions** | Categorizes where the position belongs |
| **Filtering** | You can filter views to show only FOH or BOH |

### Examples

**FOH Positions:** Register, Drive-Thru, Host, Dining Room, Drinks

**BOH Positions:** Grill, Prep, Fries, Breading, Expeditor

Some employees may be marked as **Both** if they work in both areas.

---

## Positions and Rating Criteria

### Positions

A **position** is a specific job someone does. Your organization defines what positions exist.

Each position has:
- A name (e.g., "Drive-Thru", "Grill")
- A description of what the job involves
- An FOH or BOH designation
- 5 rating criteria

### Rating Criteria

Each position has exactly **5 criteria** that define what you're evaluating. These are sometimes called the "Big 5."

For example, a **Register** position might have:
1. Speed
2. Accuracy
3. Guest Interaction
4. Menu Knowledge
5. Payment Handling

When you rate someone in a position, you score each of these 5 criteria.

### The 1-3 Scale

Ratings use a simple scale:

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **1** | Not Yet | Still developing, needs improvement |
| **2** | On the Rise | Making progress, getting better |
| **3** | Crushing It | Consistently excellent |

---

## The Dashboard

The **dashboard** is the main web interface at [app.levelset.io](https://app.levelset.io).

### Main Sections

| Section | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Home** | Overview metrics for your location |
| **Positional Excellence** | Ratings for all employees, multiple views |
| **Discipline** | Infractions, points, and recommended actions |
| **Roster** | All employees at your location |

### Navigation

The top navigation bar includes:

- **Levelset logo** - Click to go home
- **Section links** - Home, Positional Excellence, Discipline, Roster
- **Location selector** - Switch between locations
- **Help icon** - Opens this documentation
- **Profile menu** - Settings and log out

### Settings Access

Click your **profile icon** (top right) and select **Organization Settings** to configure:

- Positions and rating criteria
- Roles
- Users
- Discipline settings

<Note>
You need appropriate permissions to access settings. Most settings require an Operator or Director role.
</Note>

## How It All Connects

Here's how the key concepts work together:

```
Organization
    │
    ├── Defines: Positions, Criteria, Roles
    │
    └── Contains: Locations
                      │
                      ├── Contains: Employees
                      │                 │
                      │                 ├── Have a Role (determines permissions)
                      │                 ├── Are FOH/BOH (determines rateable positions)
                      │                 └── Can be rated and have discipline
                      │
                      └── Data: Ratings, Infractions, Reports
```

**Example flow:**

1. Your organization defines a "Register" position with 5 criteria
2. At Location #123, Sarah is an employee marked as FOH
3. A Manager at Location #123 logs into the dashboard
4. The Manager rates Sarah on the "Register" position
5. Sarah's rating appears in the Positional Excellence dashboard
6. Over time, her rolling average updates as she receives more ratings
